OSMS has received a generous donation of X non-woven polypropylene (NWPP) bags from [retailer redacted until cleared]. Our local response groups have access to this donation to support their efforts in sewing face masks. 

NWPP is an ideal material for this purpose because of its material properties and droplet resistance. Our [partners at Maker Mask have compiled a resource](https://makermask.org/the-big-four-criteria-for-community-mask-materials/) about the benefits of using NWPP as a face mask material. While it can sometimes be challenging to accurately identify appropriate sources of NWPP for face masks, this donation represents a large volume of high-quality material available immediately to our volunteers.

**It is time to mobilize our local response networks to make use of this supply and distribute finished masks as quickly as possible.**

- **Step 1: Locate and Distribute Donated NWPP Near You**

    [steps for getting information about accessing the supplies - awaiting details from Bill] 

    Once your chapter has gathered materials from the central hub, the bags will need to be broken down into kits for your sewists. As we receive feedback from our pilot sites, this page will be updated with guidance for efficiently breaking down the donated bags. 

    Distribute the NWPP kits to sewists in your network. If your local response group consists primarily of 3D printers or does not include sewists, conduct outreach to sewing groups in your area. Maintain records of the quantity of supplies distributed to each sewist so that you can follow up. 

- **Step 2: Create Quality Masks**

    Our partners at Maker Mask have developed patterns that are ideal for use with this material. Depending on requests in your local community, you may select either the [surgical-style Surge](https://makermask.org/masks/surge/) or the [dome-shaped N95 Cover](https://makermask.org/masks/cover/). If in doubt, use the [Surge](https://makermask.org/masks/surge/). These patterns have been evaluated by the OSMS Medical Team and are best suited to this purpose.  

    When working, follow best practices for hygiene. [link]

- **Step 3: Assemble Documentation**

    Every mask you distribute in the community should include instructions for how to use and sanitize it. 

    - For bulk donations (to organizations) it is acceptable to include 2 copies per box or bag of masks distributed.
        - Sample Bulk Information Sheet for Surge [link]
        - Sample Bulk Information for Cover [link]
    - For masks donated individually, we recommend including a separate documentation sheet with each mask.
        - Sample Individual Information Sheet for Surge [link]
        - Sample Individual Information Sheet for Cover [link]

- **Step 4: Donate Masks to Local Sites**

    Once decontaminated, masks are suitable for donation to a variety of community sites. 

    **Whenever masks made from this donated material are dropped off, it is essential to [log the relevant information here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDOj0qfWDNrGgOVyBtH7E6dc3qPwCKRT9j_wk7UjIutqtTAg/viewform?usp=sf_link)**. (Please note that this log is only for masks made using NWPP from this donation.) The log should be completed by the person dropping off the completed masks at their final donation site. 

    Logging the data helps us to quantify the impact of this donation, including the total number of masks produced, the types of community organizations being served, and the geographic spread of this donation. It also allows us to provide organizational transparency and accountability, which in turn help us to build trust with the public and potential donors.

    We recommend having a volunteer coordinate pick-ups of finished masks from individual sewists. Prior to final drop-off, masks can be inspected for basic quality control, counted, and [logged in the reporting sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDOj0qfWDNrGgOVyBtH7E6dc3qPwCKRT9j_wk7UjIutqtTAg/viewform). This will allow for masks to be donated in batches and minimize the number of volunteers physically visiting hospitals and other facilities.

    As always, help and support is available for you. We recommend contacting the OSMS Local Response Administrators via the #local-response-connect Slack channel. You can also access support by emailing mfirke@opensourcemedicalsupplies.org.
